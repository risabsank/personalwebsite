Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
There are 4 pages: 1 homepage, 3 pages describing my interests. There are 5
files used for images that I displayed on the website. index.html is the homepage.
badminton.html is the page describing my interest in the sport. It contains
a bootstrap component called the list group.
interestpage.html is a page dedicated to describing some of my general interests. violin.html describes my interest in html. stylesheet.css provides the styling for pages: badminton.html, index.html, and interestpage.html. It has 5 CSS selectors and a couple of classes and id's.
I used the scss to style the violin page. The violin page also utilizes bootstrap columns.
In features.scss, I used nesting to change font color, but maintain font-size, and
I used inheritance with %styles to style the font.
