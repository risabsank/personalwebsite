      <h3>Throughout my life, I have had many interests. As the years have passed, some have changed,
        while some have remained the same. These are my interests at the moment:</h3>
        <ul>
          <img src = "download.jpg" style = "float:right">
          <h4><li>Basketball</li></h4>
          <div id = "content">I love basketball. I love watching the Warriors play, I love playing
          it with my friends, and I love talking with my dad about how the Warriors
          will win this season. I love the joy that comes with watching Stephen
          Curry drain a long-range three and LeBron James throwing a ferocious dunk.
          Though I am not the best basketball player, I really like basketball.</div>
          <img src = "i.png" width = 25% style = "float:left">
          <h4><li>Cleveland Browns</li></h4>
          <div id = "content">As you can see, I am very interested in sports. In California, sports
          play an important role of the community. San Ramon avidly supports the San
          Franciso 49ers, so it is often diffiicult to be a fan of the Cleveland Browns.
          In fifth grade, each student was assigned a football team and I was given the
          Cleveland Browns. I have stayed loyal since then, yet unfortunately, they have
          been terrible. One day, we will win. I know it. Our core is young, but our will
          to win is stronger than ever before.
          </div>
          <h4><li>Boy Scouts of America</li></h4>
          <div id = "content">I have been a Boy Scout since eight grade and as of now I am a Life Scout.
          I have been pretty dedicated to being a Scout as I have done everything possible to be
          as involved as I can in my troop. Most Boy Scouts start at the age of 10, so I
          joined the troop 3 years later than normal, pushing me to work harder. Troop 874,
          located in San Ramon has enabled me to push myself out of my comfort zone and
          develop my skills as a Scout through the past 3 years. I hope to become an Eagle Scout
          next year.
